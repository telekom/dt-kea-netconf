% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_FAILED buffer4_receive callout failed: %1
This error message is issued when the callout for the buffer4_receive hook
point failed.  This may occur as a result of an internal server error.
The argument contains a reason for the error.

% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_NOT_FOR_US %1: dropping query to be processed by another server
This debug message is issued when the received DHCPv4 query is dropped
by this server because it should be served by another server. This
is the case when the remote server was designated to process the packet
as a result of load balancing or because it is a primary server in the
hot standby configuration. The argument provides client identification
information retrieved from the query.

% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_PACKET_OPTIONS_SKIPPED an error upacking an option, caused subsequent options to be skipped: %1
A debug message issued when an option failed to unpack correctly, making it
impossible to unpack the remaining options in the DHCPv4 query. The server
will still attempt to service the packet. The sole argument provides a
reason for unpacking error.

% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_UNPACK_FAILED failed to parse query from %1 to %2, received over interface %3, reason: %4
This debug message is issued when received DHCPv4 query is malformed and
can't be parsed by the buffer4_receive callout. The query will be
dropped by the server. The first three arguments specify source IP address,
destination IP address and the interface. The last argument provides a
reason for failure.

% HA_BUFFER6_RECEIVE_FAILED buffer6_receive callout failed: %1
This error message is issued when the callout for the buffer6_receive hook
point failed. This may occur as a result of an internal server error.
The argument contains a reason for the error.

% HA_BUFFER6_RECEIVE_NOT_FOR_US %1: dropping query to be processed by another server
This debug message is issued when the received DHCPv6 query is dropped
by this server because it should be served by another server. This
is the case when the remote server was designated to process the packet
as a result of load balancing or because it is a primary server in the
hot standby configuration. The argument provides client identification
information retrieved from the query.

% HA_BUFFER6_RECEIVE_PACKET_OPTIONS_SKIPPED an error upacking an option, caused subsequent options to be skipped: %1

This error message is issued when the callout for the command_processed hook
point failed. The argument contains a reason for the error.

% HA_COMMUNICATION_INTERRUPTED communication with %1 is interrupted
This warning message is issued by the server which discovered that the
communication to the active partner has been interrupted for a time
period longer than the configured heartbeat-delay time. At this stage
the server starts the failover procedure by monitoring the DHCP traffic
sent to the partner and checking whether the partner server responds to
this traffic. If the max-unacked-clients value is set to 0 such
verification is disabled in which case the server will transition to
the partner-down state.

% HA_COMMUNICATION_INTERRUPTED_CLIENT4 %1: new client attempting to get a lease from the partner
This informational message is issued when the surviving server observes
a DHCP packet sent to the partner with which the communication is interrupted.
The client whose packet is observed is not yet considered "unacked" because
the secs field value does not exceed the configured threshold specified
with max-ack-delay.

% HA_COMMUNICATION_INTERRUPTED_CLIENT4_UNACKED %1: partner server failed to respond, %2 clients unacked so far, %3 clients left before transitioning to the partner-down state
This informational message is issued when the surviving server determines
that its partner failed to respond to the DHCP query and that this client
is considered to not be served by the partner. The surviving server counts
such clients and if the number of such clients exceeds the max-unacked-clients
threshold, the server will transition to the partner-down state. The first
argument contains client identification information. The second argument
specifies the number of clients to which the server has failed to respond.
The third argument specifies the number of additional clients which, if not
provisioned, will cause the server to transition to the partner-down state.

% HA_COMMUNICATION_INTERRUPTED_CLIENT6 %1: new client attempting to get a lease from the partner
This informational message is issued when the surviving server observes
a DHCP packet sent to the partner with which the communication is interrupted.
The client whose packet is observed is not yet considered "unacked" because
the elapsed time option value does not exceed the configured threshold
specified with max-ack-delay. The sole argument specifies client
identification information.

% HA_COMMUNICATION_INTERRUPTED_CLIENT6_UNACKED %1: partner server failed to respond, %2 clients unacked so far, %3 clients left before transitioning to the partner-down state
This informational message is issued when the surviving server determines
that its partner failed to respond to the DHCP query and that this client
is considered to not be served by the partner. The surviving server counts
such clients and if the number of such clients exceeds the max-unacked-clients
threshold, the server will transition to the partner-down state. The first
argument contains client identification information. The second argument
specifies the number of clients to which the server has failed to respond.
The third argument specifies the number of additional clients which, if not
provisioned, will cause the server to transition to the partner-down state.

% HA_CONFIGURATION_FAILED failed to configure High Availability hooks library: %1
This error message is issued when there is an error configuring the HA hooks
library. The argument provides the detailed error message.

% HA_CONFIGURATION_SUCCESSFUL HA hook library has been successfully configured
This informational message is issued when the HA hook library configuration
parser successfully parses and validates the new configuration.

% HA_CONFIG_AUTO_FAILOVER_DISABLED auto-failover disabled for %1
This warning message is issued to indicate that the 'auto-failover' parameter
was administratively disabled for the specified server. The server will not
automatically start serving partner's scope when the partner failure is detected.
The server administrator will need to enable this scope manually by
sending appropriate ha-scopes command.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_SYNCING_DISABLED lease database synchronization between HA servers is disabled
This warning message is issued when the lease database synchronization is
administratively disabled. This is valid configuration if the leases are
replicated between lease databases via some other mechanism, e.g. SQL
database replication.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_SYNCING_DISABLED_REMINDER bypassing SYNCING state because lease database synchronization is administratively disabled
This informational message is issued as a reminder that lease database
synchronization is administratively disabled and therefore the server
transitions directly from the "waiting" to "ready" state.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_UPDATES_AND_SYNCING_DIFFER unusual configuration where "send-lease-updates": %1 and "sync-leases": %2
This warning message is issued when the configuration values of the
send-lease-updates and sync-leases parameters differ. This may be a
valid configuration but is unusual. Normally, if the lease database
with replication is in use, both values are set to false. If a lease
database without replication is in use (e.g. memfile), both values
are set to true. Providing different values for those parameters means
that an administrator either wants the server to not synchronize
leases upon startup but later send lease updates to the partner, or
the lease database should be synchronized upon startup, but no lease
updates are later sent as a result of leases allocation.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_UPDATES_DISABLED lease updates will not be generated
This warning message is issued when the lease updates are administratively
disabled. This is valid configuration if the leases are replicated to the
partner's database via some other mechanism, e.g. SQL database replication.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_UPDATES_DISABLED_REMINDER lease updates are administratively disabled and will not be generated while in %1 state
This informational message is issued as a reminder that the lease updates
are administratively disabled and will not be issued in the HA state to
which the server has transitioned. The sole argument specifies the state
into which the server has transitioned.

This warning message indicates that a peer returned an error status code
in response to a heartbeat. This is the sign that the peer may not function
properly. The server will keep trying to send heartbeats until it considers
that communication is interrupted.

% HA_HEARTBEAT_HANDLER_FAILED heartbeat command failed: %1
This error message is issued to indicate that the heartbeat command handler
failed while processing the command. The argument provides the reason for
failure.

% HA_HIGH_CLOCK_SKEW %1, please synchronize clocks!
This warning message is issued when the clock skew between the active servers
exceeds 30 seconds. The HA service continues to operate but may not function
properly, especially for low lease lifetimes. The administrator should
should synchronize the clocks, e.g. using NTP. If the clock skew exceeds
60 seconds, the HA service will terminate.

% HA_HIGH_CLOCK_SKEW_CAUSES_TERMINATION %1, causing HA service to terminate
This warning message is issued when the clock skew between the active servers
exceeds 60 seconds. The HA service stops. The servers will continue to respond

% HA_MAINTENANCE_SHUTDOWN_SAFE the server can now be shutdown for maintenance as the partner has taken over the DHCP traffic
This informational message is displayed after the server transitions to the
in-maintenance state. This server no longer responds to any DHCP queries and its
partner being in the partner-in-maintenance state has taken over the DHCP traffic.
When the server in-maintenance state is shut down, the partner will move to
the partner-down imediatelly.

% HA_MAINTENANCE_STARTED the server is now in the partner-in-maintenance state and the partner is in-maintenance state
This informational message is displayed when the server receiving the
ha-maintenance-start command transitions to the partner-in-maintenance
state. The server does it after sending the ha-maintenance-notify to
its partner to put the partner in the in-maintenance state. From now on,
the server in the partner-in-maintenance state will be responding to all
queries and the partner will respond to no queries. The partner may be
safely shut down for maintenance in which case this server will
automatically transition from the partner-in-maintenance state to the
partner-down state.

% HA_MAINTENANCE_STARTED_IN_PARTNER_DOWN the server is now in the partner-down mode as a result of requested maintenance
This informational message is displayed when the server receiving the
ha-maintenance-start command transitions to the partner-down state
because it was unable to communicate with the partner while receiving
the command. It is assumed that in such situation the partner is
already offline for the maintenance. Note that in this case the
normal failover procedure does not take place. The server does not wait
for a heartbeat to fail several times, nor it monitors the DHCP traffic
for not responded queries. In the maintenance case the server transitions
to the partner-down state when it first encounters a communication
problem with the partner.

% HA_MAINTENANCE_START_HANDLER_FAILED ha-maintenance-start command failed: %1
This error message is issued to indicate that the ha-maintenance-start command
handler failed while processing the command. The argument provides the reason for
failure.

% HA_MISSING_CONFIGURATION high-availability parameter not specified for High Availability hooks library
This error message is issued to indicate that the configuration for the

of server startup or reconfiguration. The first argument provides the HA mode.
The second argument specifies the role of this server instance in this
configuration.

% HA_STATE_MACHINE_CONTINUED state machine is un-paused
This informational message is issued when the HA state machine is un-paused.
This unlocks the server from the current state. It may transition to any
other state if it needs to do so, e.g. 'partner-down' if its partner appears
to be offline. The server may also remain in the current state if the HA
setup state warrants such behavior.

% HA_STATE_MACHINE_PAUSED state machine paused in state %1
This informational message is issued when the HA state machine is paused.
HA state machine may be paused in certain states specified in the HA hooks library
confuguration. When the state machine is paused, the server remains in the given
state until it is explicitly unpaused (via ha-continue command). If the state
machine is paused, the server operates normally but can't transition to any
other state.

% HA_STATE_TRANSITION server transitions from %1 to %2 state, partner state is %3
This informational message is issued when the server transitions to a new
state as a result of some interaction (or lack of thereof) with its partner.
The arguments specify initial server state, new server state and the partner's
state.

% HA_STATE_TRANSITION_PASSIVE_BACKUP server transitions from %1 to %2 state

lease database synchronization with the partner. The first argument specifies
the name of the partner server. The second argument specifies the duration of
the synchronization.

% HA_TERMINATED HA service terminated due to an unrecoverable condition. Check previous error message(s), address the problem and restart!
This error message is issued to indicate that the HA service has been stopped
due to an unacceptable condition (e.g. too large of a clock skew). The exact
cause should appear in a previous error message.  Address the condition
reported then restart the servers to resume service.

% HA_TERMINATED_RESTART_PARTNER waiting for the partner in the TERMINATED state to be restarted
This informational message is issued when the server has been restarted after
correcting the clock skew. The partner server is still in the terminated
state. The partner must be restarted before the server can synchronize the
database and start normal operation.
