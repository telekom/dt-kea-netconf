DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``kea-shell`` provides a REST client for the Kea Control Agent (CA).
It takes command as a command-line parameter that is being sent to CA
with proper JSON encapsulation. Optional arguments may be specified on
the standard input. The request it sent of HTTP and a response is
retrieved. That response is displayed out on the standard output.

ARGUMENTS
=========

The arguments are as follows:

``-h``
   Displays help regarding command line parameters.

``-v``
   Display the version.

``--host``
   Specifies the host to connect to. Control Agent must be running at
   specified host. If not specified, 127.0.0.1 is used.

``--port``
   Specifies the TCP port to connect to. Control Agent must be listening
   at specified port. If not specified, 8000 is used.

``--path``
   Specifies the path in the URL to connect to. If not specified, empty
   path is used. As Control Agent listens at the empty path this
   parameter is useful only with a reverse proxy.

``--timeout``
   Specifies the connection timeout in seconds. If not specified, 10
   (seconds) is used.

``--service``
   Specifies the service that is the target of a command. If not
   specified, Control Agent will be targeted. May be used more than once
   to specify multiple targets.

``command``
   Specifies the command to be sent to CA. If not specified,
   "list-commands" is used.
