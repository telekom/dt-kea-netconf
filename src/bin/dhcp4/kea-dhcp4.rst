with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are typically
available in various formats (txt, html, pdf) with your Kea
distribution. The Kea documentation is available at
https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-administrator-reference-manual .

HISTORY
=======

The ``b10-dhcp4`` daemon was first coded in November 2011 by Tomek
Mrugalski.

In the mid 2014 Kea was decoupled from the BIND10 framework and became a
standalone DHCP server. The DHCPv4 server binary was renamed to
kea-dhcp4. Kea 1.0.0 was released in December 2015.
