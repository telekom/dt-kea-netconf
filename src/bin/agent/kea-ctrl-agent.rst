DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``kea-ctrl-agent`` provides a REST service for controlling Kea
services. The received HTTP requests are decapsulated and forwarded to
the respective Kea services in JSON format. Received JSON responses are
encapsulated within HTTP responses and returned to the controlling
entity. Some commands may be handled by the Control Agent directly, and
not forwarded to any Kea service.

The arguments are as follows:

``-v``
   Display the version.

   server. It may also contain configuration entries for other Kea
