DESCRIPTION
===========

kea-admin is a shell script which offers database maintenance. In
particular, it features database initialization, database version
checking and database schema upgrade.

OPTIONS
=======

``command``
   Command to be issued to the servers. It can be one of the following:

   db-init
        Initializes a new database schema. This is useful
        during a new Kea installation. The database is initialized to the
        latest version supported by the version of the software being
        installed.

   db-version
        Reports the database backend version number. This
        is not necessarily equal to the Kea version number as each backend
        has its own versioning scheme.

   db-upgrade
        Conducts a database schema upgrade. This is useful when upgrading Kea.

   lease-dump
        Dumps the contents of the lease database (for MySQL,
        PostgreSQL, or CQL backends) to a CSV (comma-separated values) text
        file. The first line of the file contains the column names. This is
        meant to be used as a diagnostic tool, so it provides a portable,
        human-readable form of the lease data.

   stats-recount
        Recounts lease statistics for MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

``backend``
   Specifies backend type. Currently allowed backends are: memfile,
   mysql and pgsql.

``-u|--user username``
   Specify the username when connecting to a database. If not specified,
   the default value of keatest is used.

``-p|--password password``
   Specifies the password when connecting to a database. If not
   specified, the default value of keatest is used.

``-n|--name database-name``
   Specifies the database name to connect to. If not specified, the
   default value of keatest is used.

``-d|--directory script-directory``
   Used for override scripts directory. That script is used during
   upgrades, database initialization and possibly other operations. If
   not specified, the default value of (prefix)/share/kea/scripts/ is
   used.

``-o|--output output_file``
   Required for lease-dump, Specifies the file to which the lease data
   will be dumped.

``-v|--version``
   Prints kea-admin version and quits.

``-4``
   Directs kea-admin to lease-dump the DHCPv4 leases. Incompatible with
   the -6 option.

``-6``
   Directs kea-admin to lease-dump the DHCPv6 leases. Incompatible with
   the -4 option.
