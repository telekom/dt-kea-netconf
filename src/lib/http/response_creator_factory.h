/// The @ref HttpResponseCreator defines an interface for the classes used
/// to generate HTTP responses. Such classes are defined outside of this
/// library and they are specific to the needs of the particular module.
/// In some cases it may be desired to create new instance of the
/// @ref HttpResponseCreator implementation for every request processed.
/// The @ref HttpResponseCreatorFactory is an interface to the "factory"
/// class which generates canned @ref HttpResponseCreator instances. The
/// pointer to the factory class is passed to the @ref HttpListener and
/// the listener propagates it down to other classes. These classes call
/// @ref HttpResponseCreatorFactory::create to retrieve an instance of the
/// appropriate @ref HttpResponseCreator, which is in turn used to generate
/// HTTP response.
///
/// Note that an implementation of the @ref HttpResponseCreatorFactory::create
/// may always return the same instance of the @ref HttpResponseCreator
/// if creating new instance for each request is not required or undesired.
