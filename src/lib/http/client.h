/// @brief HTTP client class.
///
/// This class implements an asynchronous HTTP client. The caller can schedule
/// transmission of the HTTP request using @ref HttpClient::asyncSendRequest
/// method. The caller specifies target URL for each request. The caller also
/// specifies a pointer to the @ref HttpRequest or derived class, holding a
/// request that should be transmitted to the destination. Such request must
/// be finalized, i.e. @ref HttpRequest::finalize method must be called prior
/// to sending it. The caller must also provide a pointer to the
/// @ref HttpResponse object or an object derived from it. The type of the
/// response object must match the expected content type to be returned in the
/// server's response. The last argument specified in this call is the pointer
/// to the callback function, which should be launched when the response is
/// received, an error occurs or when a timeout in the transmission is
/// signalled.
///
/// The HTTP client supports multiple simultaneous and persistent connections
/// with different destinations. The client determines if the connection is
/// persistent by looking into the Connection header and HTTP version of the
/// request. If the connection should be persistent the client doesn't
/// close the connection after sending a request and receiving a response from
/// the server. If the client is provided with the request to be sent to the
/// particular destination, but there is an ongoing communication with this
/// destination, e.g. as a result of sending previous request, the new
/// request is queued in the FIFO queue. When the previous request completes,
/// the next request in the queue for the particular URL will be initiated.
///
/// The client tests the persistent connection for usability before sending
/// a request by trying to read from the socket (with message peeking). If
/// the socket is usable the client uses it to transmit the request.
///
/// This classes exposes the underlying TCP socket's descriptor for each
/// connection via connect and close callbacks.  This is done to permit the
/// sockets to be monitored for IO readiness by external code that's something
/// other than boost::asio (e.g.select() or epoll()), and would thus otherwise
/// starve the client's IOService and cause a backlog of ready event handlers.
///
/// All errors are reported to the caller via the callback function supplied
/// to the @ref HttpClient::asyncSendRequest. The IO errors are communicated
/// via the @c boost::system::error code value. The response parsing errors
/// are returned via the 3rd parameter of the callback.

    /// queued transactions are started in the FIFO order one after another. If
    /// the connection is idle or the connection doesn't exist, the new
    /// transaction is started immediatelly.
    ///
    /// The existing connection is tested before it is used for the new
    /// transaction by attempting to read (with message peeking) from the open
    /// TCP socket. If the read attempt is successful, the client will transmit
    /// the HTTP request to the server using this connection. It is possible
    /// that the server closes the connection between the connection test and
    /// sending the request. In such case, an error will be returned and the
    /// caller will need to try re-sending the request.
    ///
    /// If the connection test fails, the client will close the socket and
    /// reconnect to the server prior to sending the request.
    ///
    /// Pointers to the request and response objects are provided as arguments
    /// of this method. These pointers should have appropriate types derived
    /// from the @ref HttpRequest and @ref HttpResponse classes. For example,
    /// if the request has content type "application/json", a pointer to the
    /// @ref HttpResponseJson should be passed. In this case, the response type
    /// should be @ref HttpResponseJson. These types are used to validate both
    /// the request provided by the caller and the response received from the
    /// server.
    ///
    /// The callback function provided by the caller is invoked when the
    /// transaction terminates, i.e. when the server has responded or when an
    /// error occured. The callback is expected to be exception safe, but the
    /// client internally guards against exceptions thrown by the callback.
    ///
    /// The first argument of the callback indicates an IO error during
    /// communication with the server. If the communication is successful the
    /// error code of 0 is returned. However, in this case it is still possible
    /// that the transaction is unsuccessful due to HTTP response parsing error,
    /// e.g. invalid content type, malformed response etc. Such errors are
    /// indicated via third argument.
    ///
    /// If message parsing was successful the second argument of the callback
    /// contains a pointer to the parsed response (the same pointer as provided
    ///by the caller as the argument). If parsing was unsuccessful, the null
    /// pointer is returned.
    ///
    /// The default timeout for the transaction is set to 10 seconds
    /// (10 000 ms). If the timeout occurs, the callback is invoked with the
    /// error code of @c boost::asio::error::timed_out.
    /// The timeout covers both the connect and the transaction phases
    /// so when connecting to the server takes too long (e.g. with a
    /// misconfigured firewall) the timeout is triggered. The connect
    /// callback can be used to recognize this condition.
