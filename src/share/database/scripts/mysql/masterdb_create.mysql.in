# This is the Kea schema specification for Cassandra CQL.
#
# The schema is reasonably portable (with the exception of the engine
# specification, which is Cassandra CQL-specific).  Minor changes might be needed for
# other databases.

# To create the schema, either type the command:
#
# mysql -u <user> -p <password> <database> < masterdb_create.mysql
#
# ... at the command prompt, or log in to the MySQL database and at the 'mysql>'
# prompt, issue the command:
#
# source masterdb_create.mysql
#
# This script is also called from kea-admin, see kea-admin db-init mysql
#
# Over time, Kea database schema will evolve. Each version is marked with
# major.minor version. This file is organized sequentially, i.e. database
# is initialized to 1.0, then upgraded to 2.0 etc. This may be somewhat
# sub-optimal, but it ensues consistency with upgrade scripts. (It is much
# easier to maintain init and upgrade scripts if they look the same).
# Since initialization is done only once, it's performance is not an issue.

# Finally, the version of the schema.  We start at 1.0 during development.
# This table is only modified during schema upgrades.  For historical reasons
# (related to the names of the columns in the BIND 10 DNS database file), the
# first column is called "version" and not "major".
