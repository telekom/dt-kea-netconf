-- This is the Kea DHCP schema specification for PostgreSQL.
--
-- The schema is reasonably portable (with the exception of some field types
-- specification, which are PostgreSQL-specific).  Minor changes might be needed
-- for other databases.
--
-- To create the schema, either type the command:
--
-- psql -U <user> -W <password> <database> < config_upgrade_1.0_to_2.0.pgsql
--
-- ... at the command prompt, or log in to the PostgreSQL database and at the "postgres=#"
-- prompt, issue the command:
--
-- @config_upgrade_1.0_to_2.0.pgsql

-- Start a single transaction for the entire script.
START TRANSACTION;

ALTER TABLE subnet4 ADD timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE subnet6 ADD timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL;

UPDATE config_schema_version
    SET version = 2, minor = 0
    WHERE version = 1 AND minor = 0;

-- This line concludes database upgrade to version 2.0.

-- Commit the script transaction.
COMMIT;
