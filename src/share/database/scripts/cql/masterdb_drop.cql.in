-- This is the Kea schema specification for Cassandra CQL.
--
-- The schema is reasonably portable (with the exception of the engine
-- specification, which is Cassandra CQL-specific).  Minor changes might be needed for
-- other databases.

-- To create the schema, either type the command:
--
-- cqlsh -u <user> -p <password> -k <database> -f masterdb_drop.cql
--
-- ... at the command prompt, or log in to the CQL database and at the "cqlsh>"
-- prompt, issue the command:
--
-- SOURCE masterdb_drop.cql
--
-- This script is also called from kea-admin, see kea-admin db-init cql
--
-- Over time, Kea database schema will evolve. Each version is marked with
-- major.minor version. This file is organized sequentially, i.e. database
-- is initialized to 1.0, then upgraded to 2.0 etc. This may be somewhat
-- sub-optimal, but it ensues consistency with upgrade scripts. (It is much
-- easier to maintain init and upgrade scripts if they look the same).
-- Since initialization is done only once, it's performance is not an issue.
