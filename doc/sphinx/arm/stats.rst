Statistics Overview
===================

Both Kea DHCP servers support statistics gathering. A working DHCP
server encounters various events that can cause certain statistics to be
collected. For example, a DHCPv4 server may receive a packet
(the pkt4-received statistic increases by one) that after parsing is
identified as a DHCPDISCOVER (pkt4-discover-received). The server
processes it and decides to send a DHCPOFFER representing its answer
(the pkt4-offer-sent and pkt4-sent statistics increase by one). Such events
happen frequently, so it is not uncommon for the statistics to have
values in the high thousands. They can serve as an easy and powerful
tool for observing a server's and a network's health. For example, if
the pkt4-received statistic stops growing, it means that the clients'
packets are not reaching the server.

There are four types of statistics:

-  *integer* - this is the most common type. It is implemented as a
   64-bit integer (int64_t in C++), so it can hold any value between
   -2^63 to 2^63-1.

-  *floating point* - this type is intended to store floating-point
   precision. It is implemented as a C++ double type.

-  *duration* - this type is intended for recording time periods. It
   uses the \`boost::posix_time::time_duration type, which stores hours,
   minutes, seconds, and microseconds.

-  *string* - this type is intended for recording statistics in textual
   form. It uses the C++ std::string type.

During normal operation, the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers gather
statistics. For a list of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 statistics, see
:ref:`dhcp4-stats` and :ref:`dhcp6-stats`, respectively.

To extract data from the statistics module, the control channel can be
used. See :ref:`ctrl-channel` for details. It is possible to
retrieve a single statistic or all statistics, reset statistics (i.e.
set to a neutral value, typically zero), or even completely remove a
single statistic or all statistics. See the section :ref:`command-stats`
for a list of statistics-oriented commands.

Statistics can be used by external tools to monitor Kea. One example of such a tool is Stork.
See :ref:`stork` for details how to use it to retrieve statistics periodically (and use
other data sources) to get better insight into Kea health and operational status.

.. _stats-lifecycle:

Statistics Lifecycle
====================

In Kea 1.6.0 version and earlier, when the Kea server is started some
of the statistics are initially not initialized. For example, the ``pkt4-received``
statistic is not available until the first DHCP packet is received.
In the later Kea versions, this behavior has been changed and all of the
statistics supported by the servers are initialized upon the servers' startup
and should be returned in response to the commands such as
``statistic-get-all``. The runtime statistics concerning DHCP packets
processed is initially set to 0 and is reset upon the server
restart.

Per-subnet statistics are recalculated when reconfiguration takes place.

In general, once a statistic is initialized it is held in the manager until
explicitly removed, by ``statistic-remove`` or ``statistic-remove-all``
being called, or when the server is shut down.

Removing a statistic that is updated frequently makes little sense, as
it will be re-added when the server code next records that statistic.
The ``statistic-remove`` and ``statistic-remove-all`` commands are
intended to remove statistics that are not expected to be observed in
the near future. For example, a misconfigured device in a network may
cause clients to report duplicate addresses, so the server will report
increasing values of pkt4-decline-received. Once the problem is found
and the device is removed, the system administrator may want to remove
the pkt4-decline-received statistic, so it will not be reported anymore. If
a duplicate address is ever detected again, the server will add this
statistic back.

.. _command-stats:

Commands for Manipulating Statistics
====================================

There are several commands defined that can be used for accessing
(-get), resetting to zero or a neutral value (-reset), or removing a
statistic completely (-remove). We can change the statistics time based
limit (-sample-age-set) and size based limit (-sample-count-set) which
control how long or how many samples of the given statistic are retained.

The difference between reset and remove is somewhat subtle.
The reset command sets the value of the statistic to zero or a neutral value,
so after this operation, the statistic will have a value of 0 (integer),
0.0 (float), 0h0m0s0us (duration), or "" (string).
When requested, a statistic with the values mentioned will be returned.
``Remove`` removes a statistic completely, so the statistic will no longer
be reported. Please note that the server code may add it back if there is a reason
to record it.

.. note::

   The following sections describe commands that can be sent to the
   server; the examples are not fragments of a configuration file. For
   more information on sending commands to Kea, see
   :ref:`ctrl-channel`.

.. _command-statistic-get:

The statistic-get Command
-------------------------

The ``statistic-get`` command retrieves a single statistic. It takes a
single-string parameter called ``name``, which specifies the statistic
name. An example command may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-get",
       "arguments": {
           "name": "pkt4-received"
       }
   }

The server returns details of the requested statistic, with a result of
0 indicating success and the specified statistic as the value of the
"arguments" parameter. If the requested statistic is not found, the
response will contain an empty map, i.e. only { } as an argument, but
the status code will still indicate success (0).
An example response:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-get",
       "arguments": {
           "pkt4-received": [ [ 125, "2019-07-30 10:11:19.498739" ], [ 100, "2019-07-30 10:11:19.498662" ] ]
       },
       "result": 0
   }

.. _command-statistic-reset:

The statistic-reset Command
---------------------------

The ``statistic-reset`` command sets the specified statistic to its
neutral value: 0 for integer, 0.0 for float, 0h0m0s0us for time
duration, and "" for string type. It takes a single-string parameter
called ``name``, which specifies the statistic name. An example command
may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-reset",
       "arguments": {
           "name": "pkt4-received"
       }
   }

If the specific statistic is found and the reset is successful, the
server responds with a status of 0, indicating success, and an empty
parameters field. If an error is encountered (e.g. the requested
statistic was not found), the server returns a status code of 1 (error)
and the text field contains the error description.

.. _command-statistic-remove:

The statistic-remove Command
----------------------------

The ``statistic-remove`` command attempts to delete a single statistic. It
takes a single-string parameter called ``name``, which specifies the
statistic name. An example command may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-remove",
       "arguments": {
           "name": "pkt4-received"
       }
   }

If the specific statistic is found and its removal is successful, the
server responds with a status of 0, indicating success, and an empty
parameters field. If an error is encountered (e.g. the requested
statistic was not found), the server returns a status code of 1 (error)
and the text field contains the error description.

.. _command-statistic-get-all:

The statistic-get-all Command
-----------------------------

The ``statistic-get-all`` command retrieves all statistics recorded. An
example command may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-get-all",
       "arguments": { }
   }

The server responds with details of all recorded statistics, with a
result set to 0 to indicate that it iterated over all statistics (even
when the total number of statistics is zero).
An example response returning all collected statistics:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-get-all",
       "arguments": {
           "cumulative-assigned-addresses": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386740" ] ],
           "declined-addresses": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386733" ] ],
           "reclaimed-declined-addresses": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386735" ] ],
           "reclaimed-leases": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386736" ] ],
           "subnet[1].assigned-addresses": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386740" ] ],
           "subnet[1].cumulative-assigned-addresses": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386740" ] ],
           "subnet[1].declined-addresses": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386743" ] ],
           "subnet[1].reclaimed-declined-addresses": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386745" ] ],
           "subnet[1].reclaimed-leases": [ [ 0, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386747" ] ],
           "subnet[1].total-addresses": [ [ 200, "2019-07-30 10:04:28.386719" ] ]
       },
       "result": 0
   }

.. _command-statistic-reset-all:

The statistic-reset-all Command
-------------------------------

The ``statistic-reset`` command sets all statistics to their neutral
values: 0 for integer, 0.0 for float, 0h0m0s0us for time duration, and
"" for string type. An example command may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-reset-all",
       "arguments": { }
   }

If the operation is successful, the server responds with a status of 0,
indicating success, and an empty parameters field. If an error is
encountered, the server returns a status code of 1 (error) and the text
field contains the error description.

.. _command-statistic-remove-all:

The statistic-remove-all Command
--------------------------------

The ``statistic-remove-all`` command attempts to delete all statistics. An
example command may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-remove-all",
       "arguments": { }
   }

If the removal of all statistics is successful, the server responds with
a status of 0, indicating success, and an empty parameters field. If an
error is encountered, the server returns a status code of 1 (error) and
the text field contains the error description.

.. _command-statistic-sample-age-set:

The statistic-sample-age-set Command
----------------------------------------

The ``statistic-sample-age-set`` command sets time based limit
for collecting samples for given statistic. It takes two parameters a string
called ``name``, which specifies the statistic name and integer value called
``duration``, which specifies the time limit for given statistic in seconds.
An example command may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-sample-age-set",
       "arguments": {
           "name": "pkt4-received",
           "duration": 1245
       }

   }

The server will respond with message about successfully set limit
for the given statistic, with a result set to 0 indicating success
and an empty parameters field. If an error is encountered (e.g. the
requested statistic was not found), the server returns a status code
of 1 (error) and the text field contains the error description.

.. _command-statistic-sample-age-set-all:

The statistic-sample-age-set-all Command
--------------------------------------------

The ``statistic-sample-age-set-all`` command sets time based limits
for collecting samples for all statistics. It takes single-integer parameter
called ``duration``, which specifies the time limit for given statistic
in seconds. An example command may look like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-sample-age-set-all",
       "arguments": {
           "duration": 1245
       }

   }

The server will respond with message about successfully set limit
for all statistics, with a result set to 0 indicating success
and an empty parameters field. If an error is encountered, the server returns
a status code of 1 (error) and the text field contains the error description.

.. _command-statistic-sample-count-set:

The statistic-sample-count-set Command
------------------------------------------

The ``statistic-sample-count-set`` command sets size based limit
for collecting samples for given statistic. An example command may look
like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-sample-count-set",
       "arguments": {
           "name": "pkt4-received",
           "max-samples": 100
       }

   }

The server will respond with message about successfully set limit
for the given statistic, with a result set to 0 indicating success
and an empty parameters field. If an error is encountered (e.g. the
requested statistic was not found), the server returns a status code
of 1 (error) and the text field contains the error description.

.. _command-statistic-sample-count-set-all:

The statistic-sample-count-set-all Command
----------------------------------------------

The ``statistic-sample-count-set-all`` command sets size based limits
for collecting samples for all statistics. An example command may look
like this:

::

   {
       "command": "statistic-sample-count-set-all",
       "arguments": {
           "max-samples": 100
       }

   }

The server will respond with message about successfully set limit
for all statistics, with a result set to 0 indicating success
and an empty parameters field. If an error is encountered, the server returns
a status code of 1 (error) and the text field contains the error description.

.. _time-series:

Time series
====================

Previously, by default, each statistic held only a single data point. When Kea
attempted to record a new value, the existing previous value was overwritten.
That approach has the benefit of taking up little memory and it covers most
cases reasonably well. However, there may be cases where you need to have many
data points for some process. For example, some processes, such as received
packet size, packet processing time or number of database queries needed to
process a packet, are not cumulative and it would be useful to keep many data
points, perhaps to do some form of statistical analysis afterwards.


Since Kea 1.6, by default, each statistic holds 20 data points. Setting such
limit prevent unlimited memory consumption growth.
There are two ways to define the limts: time based (e.g. keep samples from
the last 5 minutes) and size based. It's possible to change the size based
limit by using one of two commands: ``statistic-sample-count-set``,
to set size limit for single statistic and ``statistic-sample-count-set-all``
for setting size based limits for all statistics. To set time based
limit for single statistic use ``statistic-sample-age-set``, and
``statistic-sample-age-set-all`` to set time based limits for all statistics.
For given statistic only one type of limit can be active. It means that storage
is limited only by time based limit or size based, never by both of them.
