lease_query: Leasequery
=======================

This library provides support for DHCPv4 Leasequery as described in
`RFC 4388 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4388>`__; and for DHCPv6
Lease Query (`RFC 5007 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5007>`__).

.. note::

   This library may only be loaded by the ``kea-dhcp4`` or
   ``kea-dhcp6`` process.

The Leasequery library is only available to ISC customers with a paid support contract.

.. _lease-query-dhcpv4:

DHCPv4 Leasequery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DHCPv4 simple Leasequery provides a requester the ability to query for
active lease information for either a single IP address or a single client.
RFC 4388 calls for three such queries:

- Query by IP address

    The IP address of interest is contained within the ``ciaddr`` field of
    the query.
- Query by hardware address

    The hardware address of interest is contained with the ``chaddr`` field
    of the query.
- Query by client identifier

    The client identifier of interest is sent in the dhcp-client-identifier
    option (61) of the query.

The inbound DHCPLEASEQUERY packet must supply only one of the three values
above.  Queries which supply more than one of these values are dropped.

In addition, the query must contain the IP address of the requester in
``giaddr``. This value will be used not only as the destination for the
query response but also to validate the requester against a known
list of IP addresses which are permitted to query.  This list of valid
requester addresses is specified as part of the Leasequery hook library's
configuration (See the section on configuration below).

In response to a valid query, the server will return one of three message
types:

- DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN

    Returned when the IP address of interest is not one the server knows
    about (query by IP address); or there are no active leases for the
    client of interest (query by hardware address or client id).

- DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED

    Returned when the IP address is one the server knows of but for which
    there are no active leases (applies only to query by IP address).

- DHCPLEASEACTIVE

    Returned when there is at least one active lease found matching the
    criteria.

For both DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN and DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED responses, the only
information sent back to the requester in response is the query parameter
itself (i.e. one of: IP address, hardware address, or client identifier).

For DHCPLEASEACTIVE the server will provide the following information
for the newest active lease that matches the criteria, in the response:

- ciaddr - set to the lease's IP address
- chaddr - set to the lease's hardware address

In addition, one or more of the following options will be included:

   +------------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------+

The dhcp-server-identifier option (54) will be returned in all responses in keeping with
RFC 2131 section 4.3.1.

RFC 4388 allows requesters to ask for specific options via the
dhcp-parameter-request-list (PRL, option 55). This is not currently supported but
may be added at a future date.

.. _lease-query-dhcpv4-config:

DHCPv4 Leasequery Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring the Leasequery hook library for use is straight forward.  It currently
supports a single parameter, ``requesters``, which is a list of IP addresses from
which DHCPLEASEQUERY packets will be accepted.  In other words, it is a list of
known requesters.  The following shows an example configuration with two requester
addresses:

::

 :
    "hooks-libraries": [
        {
            "library": "lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_lease_query.so",
            "parameters": {
                "requesters": [ "192.0.1.1", "10.0.0.2" ]
            }
        }
    ],
 :

.. note::

    For security purposes, there is no way to specify wildcards. Each requester address
    must be explicitly listed.

.. _lease-query-dhcpv6:

DHCPv6 Leasequery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DHCPv6 simple Leasequery provides a requester the ability to query for
active lease information for either a single IP address or a single client
DUID.  The query type and parameters are conveyed in an ``lq-query`` option (44)
attached to a DHCPV6_LEASEQUERY message.  Briefly,

- query-type

    This is either ``query-by-address`` (1) or ``query-by-clientid`` (2)

- link-address

    Global link address, when not empty, instructs the query to be
    limited to leases within that "link".  Kea uses this value to
    select only leases that belong to subnets whose prefix matches
    this value.  Note that active leases for prefix delegations for
    a matched subnet will be included in the query reply, even if the
    delegated prefix itself falls outside the subnet prefix.

- query-options

    A single ``iaaddr`` option (12) must be supplied when querying by address.
    When querying by client ID, a single ``clientid`` option (1) must be
    supplied. RFC 5007 also calls for an optional, ``oro`` option (6), to
    request specific options be returned for matched leases.  This is
    not currently implemented.

.. note::

    `RFC 5007, Section 3.3 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5007#section-3.3>`__
    states that querying by IP address should return either a lease (e.g.
    binding) for the address itself or a lease for a delegated prefix that
    contains the address.  The latter is not currently implemented. Leases for
    delegated prefixes may only be returned when querying by client ID. See
    `gitlab issue #1275 <https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea/-/issues/1275>`__

DHCPV6_LEASEQUERY queries will only be honored if the source address of
the query matches an entry in a list of known IP addresses which are
permitted to query. This list of valid requester addresses is specified
as part of the Leasequery hook libraryâ€™s configuration (See the section
on configuration below).  Queries received from unknown requesters will be
logged and dropped.

In response to a valid query, the server will carry out the requisite
activities and return a DHCPV6_LEASEQUERY_REPLY.  All replies will contain
at least a ``status-code`` option (13) that indicates the outcome of the query
as detailed in the following table:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.5\linewidth}|p{0.3\linewidth}|p{0.1\linewidth}|p{0.3\linewidth}|

   +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------+------------------------------+

For those scenarios where the query was either invalid or no matching, active
leases were found the DHCPV6_LEASEQUERY_REPLY will only contain the status-code
option (12) per the above table.

When a query finds active leases in more than one subnet and query's link-address
is empty, then in addition to the status-code, the DHCPV6_LEASEQUERY_REPLY will
contain an ``lq-client-link`` option (48). The lq-client-link will contain a list of
IPv6 addresses, one for each subnet in which a lease was found (see
`RFC 5007, Section 4.1.2.5 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5007#section-4.1.2.5>`__)
If, however, the query's link-address is not empty, the list of queries will be
pruned to contain only leases that belong to that subnet.

When the query results in one or more active leases which all belong to a single
subnet, in addition to the status-code, the DHCPV6_LEASEQUERY_REPLY will contain a
client-data option (45) (see
`RFC 5007, Section 4.1.2.2 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5007#section-4.1.2.2>`__)
The client-data option will encapsulate the following options:

If the lease with the most recent CLTT value (Client Last
Transmission Time) has relay information in it's user-context (see
:ref:`store-extended-info-v6`), then an OPTION_LQ_RELAY_DATA option will be
added to the reply (see
`RFC 5007, Section 4.1.2.4 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5007#section-4.1.2.4>`__).

The relay information on the lease is a list with an entry for each
relay layer the client packet (e.g. DHCPV6_REQUEST) traversed, with the
first entry in list being the outermost layer (closest to the server). The
``peer-address`` field of the lq-rely-option is set to the peer address of this
relay. The list of relays is then used to construct a DHCPV6_RELAY_FORW message
equivalent to that which contained the client packet, minus the client packet.
This message is stored in the ``DHCP-relay-message`` field of the lq-relay-data option.
