Kea is an open source project designed, developed, and maintained by
Internet Systems Consortium, Inc, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. ISC
is primarily funded by revenues from support subscriptions for our open
source, and we encourage all professional users to consider this option.
To learn more, see \ https://www.isc.org/support/.

We thank all the organizations and individuals who have helped to make
Kea possible. `Comcast <https://www.comcast.com/>`__ and the Comcast
Innovation Fund provided major support for the development of Kea's
DHCPv4, DHCPv6, and DDNS modules. Mozilla funded initial work on the
REST API via a MOSS award.

Kea was initially implemented as a collection of applications within the
BIND 10 framework. We thank the founding sponsors of the BIND 10
