lease_cmds: Lease Commands
==========================

This section describes the hook library with commands used to manage
leases. Kea provides a way to store lease information in several
backends (memfile, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Cassandra), and this library
provides an interface that can manipulate leases in a unified, safe way.
In particular, it allows things previously impossible: lease
manipulation in memfile while Kea is running, sanity check changes,
lease existence checks, and removal of all leases belonging to a
specific subnet. The hook library can also catch more obscure errors, like an attempt
to add a lease with a subnet-id that does not exist in the
configuration, or configuring a lease to use an address that is outside
of the subnet to which it is supposed to belong. The library also
provides a non-programmatic way to manage user contexts associated with
leases.

.. note::

   This library may only be loaded by the ``kea-dhcp4`` or the
   ``kea-dhcp6`` process.

There are many use cases where an administrative command may be useful;
for example, during migration between servers or different vendors, when
a certain network is being retired, or when a device has been
disconnected and the system administrator knows that it will not be coming
back. The "get" queries may be useful for automating certain management
and monitoring tasks. They can also act as preparatory steps for lease
updates and removals.

This library provides the following commands:

-  ``lease4-add`` - adds a new IPv4 lease.

-  ``lease6-add`` - adds a new IPv6 lease.

-  ``lease6-bulk-apply`` - creates, updates and/or deletes multiple
   IPv6 leases in a single transaction.

-  ``lease4-get`` - checks whether an IPv4 lease with the specified
   parameters exists and returns it if it does.

-  ``lease6-get`` - checks whether an IPv6 lease with the specified
   parameters exists and returns it if it does.

-  ``lease4-get-all`` - returns all IPv4 leases or all IPv4 leases for
   the specified subnets.

-  ``lease6-get-all`` - returns all IPv6 leases or all IPv6 leases for
   the specified subnets.

-  ``lease4-get-page`` - returns a set ("page") of leases from the list
   of all IPv4 leases in the database. By iterating through the pages it
   is possible to retrieve all the leases.

-  ``lease6-get-page`` - returns a set ("page") of leases from the list
   of all IPv6 leases in the database. By iterating through the pages it
   is possible to retrieve all the leases.

-  ``lease4-get-by-hw-address`` - return all IPv4 leases with the specified
   hardware address.

-  ``lease4-get-by-client-id`` - return all IPv4 leases with the specified
   client id.

-  ``lease6-get-by-duid`` - returns all IPv6 leases with the specified DUID.

-  ``lease4-get-by-hostname`` - return all IPv4 leases with the specified
   hostname.

-  ``lease6-get-by-hostname`` - return all IPv6 leases with the specified
   hostname.

-  ``lease4-del`` - deletes an IPv4 lease with the specified parameters.

-  ``lease6-del`` - deletes an IPv6 lease with the specified parameters.

-  ``lease4-update`` - updates an IPv4 lease.

-  ``lease6-update`` - updates an IPv6 lease.

-  ``lease4-wipe`` - removes all leases from a specific IPv4 subnet or
   from all subnets.

-  ``lease6-wipe`` - removes all leases from a specific IPv6 subnet or
   from all subnets.

-  ``lease4-resend-ddns`` - resend a request to update DNS entries for
   an existing lease.

-  ``lease6-resend-ddns`` - resend a request to update DNS entries for
   an existing lease.

The lease commands library is part of the open source code and is
available to every Kea user.

All commands use JSON syntax and can be issued either using the control
channel (see :ref:`ctrl-channel`) or Control Agent (see
:ref:`kea-ctrl-agent`).

The library can be loaded in the same way as other hook libraries, and
it does not take any parameters. It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
servers.

.. _command-lease6-add:

The lease4-add, lease6-add Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``lease4-add`` and ``lease6-add`` commands allow for the creation of
a new lease. Typically Kea creates a lease when it first sees a new
device; however, sometimes it may be convenient to create the lease
manually. The ``lease4-add`` command requires at least two parameters:
an IPv4 address and an identifier, i.e. hardware (MAC) address. A third
parameter, subnet-id, is optional. If the subnet-id is not specified or
the specified value is 0, Kea will try to determine the value by running
a subnet-selection procedure. If specified, however, its value must
match the existing subnet. The simplest successful call might look as
follows:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-add",
       "arguments": {
           "ip-address": "192.0.2.202",
           "hw-address": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f"
       }
   }

The ``lease6-add`` command requires three parameters: an IPv6 address,
an IAID value (identity association identifier, a value sent by
clients), and a DUID. As with lease4-add, the subnet-id parameter is
optional. If the subnet-id is not specified or the provided value is 0,
Kea will try to determine the value by running a subnet-selection
procedure. If specified, however, its value must match the existing
subnet. For example:

::

   {
       "command": "lease6-add",
       "arguments": {
           "subnet-id": 66,
           "ip-address": "2001:db8::3",
           "duid": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f:20:21:22:23:24",
           "iaid": 1234
       }
   }

``lease6-add`` can also be used to add leases for IPv6 prefixes. In this
case there are three additional parameters that must be specified:
subnet-id, type (set to value of "IA_PD"), and prefix length. The actual
prefix is set using the ip-address field. Note that Kea cannot guess
subnet-id values for prefixes; they must be specified explicitly. For
example, to configure a lease for prefix 2001:db8:abcd::/48, the
following command can be used:

::

   {
       "command": "lease6-add",
       "arguments": {
           "subnet-id": 66,
           "type": "IA_PD",
           "ip-address": "2001:db8:abcd::",
           "prefix-len": 48,
           "duid": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f:20:21:22:23:24",
           "iaid": 1234
       }
   }

The commands can take several additional optional parameters:

-  ``valid-lft`` - specifies the lifetime of the lease, expressed in
   seconds. If not specified, the value configured in the subnet related
   to the specified subnet-id is used.

-  ``expire`` - creates a timestamp of the lease expiration time,
   expressed in UNIX format (seconds since 1 Jan 1970). If not
   specified, the default value is now + the lease lifetime (the value
   of valid-lft).

-  ``fqdn-fwd`` - specifies whether the lease should be marked as if a
   forward DNS update were conducted. Note this only affects the
   data stored in the lease database, and no DNS update will be
   performed. If configured, a DNS update to remove the A or AAAA
   records will be conducted when the lease is removed due to expiration
   or being released by a client. If not specified, the default value is
   false. The hostname parameter must be specified if fqdn-fwd is set to
   true.

-  ``fqdn-rev`` - specifies whether the lease should be marked as if
   reverse DNS update were conducted. Note this only affects the the
   data stored in the lease database, and no DNS update will be
   performed.. If configured, a DNS update to remove the PTR record will
   be conducted when the lease is removed due to expiration or being
   released by a client. If not specified, the default value is false.
   The hostname parameter must be specified if fqdn-fwd is set to true.

-  ``hostname`` - specifies the hostname to be associated with this
   lease. Its value must be non-empty if either fqdn-fwd or fwdn-rev are
   set to true. If not specified, the default value is an empty string.

-  ``hw-address`` - optionally specifies a hardware (MAC) address for an
   IPv6 lease. It is a mandatory parameter for an IPv4 lease.

-  ``client-id`` - optionally specifies a client identifier for an IPv4
   lease.

-  ``preferred-lft`` - optionally specifies a preferred lifetime for
   IPv6 leases. If not specified, the value configured for the subnet
   corresponding to the specified subnet-id is used. This parameter is
   not used when adding an IPv4 lease.

-  ``state`` - specify the state of added lease, can be 0 for ``default``,
   1 for ``declined`` and 2 for ``expired-reclaimed`` state. Any other
   value will cause error. Note that using 1 for a "IA_PD" lease type is
   illegal and will be rejected.

-  ``user-context`` - specifies the user context to be associated with
   this lease. It must be a JSON map.

Here is an example of a more complex lease addition:

::

   {
       "command": "lease6-add",
       "arguments": {
           "subnet-id": 66,
           "ip-address": "2001:db8::3",
           "duid": "01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08",
           "iaid": 1234,
           "hw-address": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f",
           "preferred-lft": 500,
           "valid-lft": 1000,
           "expire": 12345678,
           "fqdn-fwd": true,
           "fqdn-rev": true,
           "state": 0,
           "hostname": "urania.example.org",
           "user-context": { "version": 1 }
       }
   }

The command returns a status that indicates either success (result 0)
or failure (result 1). A failed command always includes a text
parameter that explains the cause of failure. For example:

::

   { "result": 0, "text": "Lease added." }

Example failure:

::

   { "result": 1, "text": "missing parameter 'ip-address' (<string>:3:19)" }


.. _command-lease6-bulk-apply:

The lease6-bulk-apply Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``lease6-bulk-apply`` was implemented to address
the performance penalty in the High Availability when a single DHCPv6
transaction resulted in multiple lease updates sent to the partner if
multiple address and/or prefix leases were allocated. Consider the case
when a DHCPv6 client requests the assignment of two IPv6 addresses and two IPv6
prefixes. That may result in allocation of 4 leases. In addition, the
DHCPv6 may assign different address than requested by the client during
the renew or rebind and delete the leases previously used by this client.
The are 6 of lease changes sent between the HA partners is in this case.
Sending these updates in individual commands, e.g. ``lease6-update``
is highly inefficient and produces unnecessary delays in communication
between the HA partners and in sending the response to the DHCPv6 client.

The ``lease6-bulk-apply`` command deals with this
problem by aggregating all lease changes in a single command. Both
deleted leases and new/updated leases are conveyed in a single command.
The receiving server iterates over the deleted leases and deletes them
from its lease database. Next, it iterates over the new/updated leases
and adds them to the database or updates them if they already exist.

Even though the High Avialability is the major application for
this command, it can be freely used in all cases when it is desired to
send multiple lease changes in a single command.

In the following example, we ask to delete two leases and to add
or update two other leases in the database:


::

    {
      "command": "lease6-bulk-apply",
      "arguments": {
          "deleted-leases": [
              {
                  "ip-address": "2001:db8:abcd::",
                  "type": "IA_PD",
                  ...
              },
              {
                  "ip-address": "2001:db8:abcd::234",
                  "type": "IA_NA",
                  ...
              }
          ],
          "leases": [
              {
                  "subnet-id": 66,
                  "ip-address": "2001:db8:cafe::",
                  "type": "IA_PD",
                   ...
              },
              {
                  "subnet-id": 66,
                  "ip-address": "2001:db8:abcd::333",
                  "type": "IA_NA",
                  ...
              }
          ]
       }
   }

If any of the leases is malformed, no leases changes are applied
to the lease database. If the leases are well formed but there is a
failure to apply any of the lease changes to the database, the command
will continue to be processed for other leases. All the leases for which
the command was unable to apply the changes in the database will be
listed in the response. For example:

::

    {
        "result": 0,
        "text": "Bulk apply of 2 IPv6 leases completed".
        "arguments": {
            "failed-deleted-leases": [
                {
                    "ip-address": "2001:db8:abcd::",
                    "type": "IA_PD",
                    "result": 3,
                    "error-message": "no lease found"
                }
            ],
            "failed-leases": [
                {
                    "ip-address": "2001:db8:cafe::",
                    "type": "IA_PD",
                    "result": 1,
                    "error-message": "unable to communicate with the lease database"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

The response above indicates that the hooks library was unable to
delete the lease for prefix "2001:db8:abcd::" and add or update the lease
for prefix "2001:db8:cafe::". However, there are two other lease changes
which have been applied as indicated by the text message. The
``result`` is the status constant that indicates the type
of the error experienced for the particular lease. The meaning of the
returned codes are the same as the results returned for the commands.
In particular, the result of 1 indicates an error while processing the
lease, e.g. a communication error with the database. The result of 3
indicates that an attempt to delete the lease was unsuccessful because
such lease doesn't exist (empty result).

.. _command-lease4-get:

.. _command-lease6-get:

The lease4-get, lease6-get Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``lease4-get`` or ``lease6-get`` can be used to query the lease database
and retrieve existing leases. There are two types of parameters the
``lease4-get`` command supports: (address) or (subnet-id,
identifier-type, identifier). There are also two types for
``lease6-get``: (address, type) or (subnet-id, identifier-type,
identifier, IAID, type). The first type of query is used when the
address (either IPv4 or IPv6) is known, but the details of the lease are
not; one common use case of this type of query is to find out whether a
given address is being used. The second query uses identifiers;
currently supported identifiers for leases are: "hw-address" (IPv4
only), "client-id" (IPv4 only), and "duid" (IPv6 only).

An example ``lease4-get`` command for getting a lease using an IPv4
address is:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-get",
       "arguments": {
           "ip-address": "192.0.2.1"
       }
   }

An example of the ``lease6-get`` query is:

::

   {
     "command": "lease6-get",
     "arguments": {
       "ip-address": "2001:db8:1234:ab::",
       "type": "IA_PD"
     }
   }

An example query by "hw-address" for an IPv4 lease looks as follows:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-get",
       "arguments": {
           "identifier-type": "hw-address",
           "identifier": "08:08:08:08:08:08",
           "subnet-id": 44
       }
   }

An example query by "client-id" for an IPv4 lease looks as follows:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-get",
       "arguments": {
           "identifier-type": "client-id",
           "identifier": "01:01:02:03:04:05:06",
           "subnet-id": 44
       }
   }

An example query by (subnet-id, identifier-type, identifier, iaid, type)
for an IPv6 lease is:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-get",
       "arguments": {
           "identifier-type": "duid",
           "identifier": "08:08:08:08:08:08",
           "iaid": 1234567,
           "type": "IA_NA",
           "subnet-id": 44
       }
   }

The type is an optional parameter. Supported values are: IA_NA
(non-temporary address) and IA_PD (IPv6 prefix). If not specified, IA_NA
is assumed.

``leaseX-get`` returns a result that indicates a result of the operation
and lease details, if found. It has one of the following values: 0
(success), 1 (error), or 3 (empty). An empty result means that a query
has been completed properly, but the object (a lease in this case) has
not been found. The lease parameters, if found, are returned as
arguments.

An example result returned when the host was found:

::

   {
     "arguments": {
       "client-id": "42:42:42:42:42:42:42:42",
       "cltt": 12345678,
       "fqdn-fwd": false,
       "fqdn-rev": true,
       "hostname": "myhost.example.com.",
       "hw-address": "08:08:08:08:08:08",
       "ip-address": "192.0.2.1",
       "state": 0,
       "subnet-id": 44,
       "valid-lft": 3600
     },
     "result": 0,
     "text": "IPv4 lease found."
   }

.. _command-lease4-get-all:

.. _command-lease6-get-all:

The lease4-get-all, lease6-get-all Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``lease4-get-all`` and ``lease6-get-all`` are used to retrieve all IPv4
or IPv6 leases, or all leases for the specified set of subnets. All
leases are returned when there are no arguments specified with the
command, as in the following example:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-get-all"
   }

If arguments are provided, it is expected that they contain the
"subnets" parameter, which is a list of subnet identifiers for which the
leases should be returned. For example, in order to retrieve all IPv6
leases belonging to the subnets with identifiers 1, 2, 3, and 4:

::

   {
       "command": "lease6-get-all",
       "arguments": {
           "subnets": [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
       }
   }

The returned response contains a detailed list of leases in the
following format:

::

   {
       "arguments": {
           "leases": [
               {
                   "cltt": 12345678,
                   "duid": "42:42:42:42:42:42:42:42",
                   "fqdn-fwd": false,
                   "fqdn-rev": true,
                   "hostname": "myhost.example.com.",
                   "hw-address": "08:08:08:08:08:08",
                   "iaid": 1,
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:2::1",
                   "preferred-lft": 500,
                   "state": 0,
                   "subnet-id": 44,
                   "type": "IA_NA",
                   "valid-lft": 3600
               },
               {
                   "cltt": 12345678,
                   "duid": "21:21:21:21:21:21:21:21",
                   "fqdn-fwd": false,
                   "fqdn-rev": true,
                   "hostname": "",
                   "iaid": 1,
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:0:0:2::",
                   "preferred-lft": 500,
                   "prefix-len": 80,
                   "state": 0,
                   "subnet-id": 44,
                   "type": "IA_PD",
                   "valid-lft": 3600
               }
           ]
       },
       "result": 0,
       "text": "2 IPv6 lease(s) found."
   }

..

.. warning::

   The ``lease4-get-all`` and ``lease6-get-all`` commands may result in
   very large responses. This may have a negative impact on the DHCP
   server's responsiveness while the response is generated and
   transmitted over the control channel, as the server imposes no
   restriction on the number of leases returned as a result of this
   command.

.. _command-lease4-get-page:

.. _command-lease6-get-page:

The lease4-get-page, lease6-get-page Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``lease4-get-all`` and ``lease6-get-all`` commands may result in
very large responses; generating such a response may consume CPU
bandwidth as well as memory. It may even cause the server to become
unresponsive. In case of large lease databases it is usually better to
retrieve leases in chunks, using the paging mechanism.
``lease4-get-page`` and ``lease6-get-page`` implement a paging mechanism
for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers respectively. The following command
retrieves the first 1024 IPv4 leases:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-get-page",
       "arguments": {
           "from": "start",
           "limit": 1024
       }
   }

The keyword ``start`` denotes that the first page of leases should be
retrieved. Alternatively, an IPv4 zero address can be specified to
retrieve the first page:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-get-page",
       "arguments": {
           "from": "0.0.0.0",
           "limit": 1024
       }
   }

Similarly, the IPv6 zero address can be specified in the
``lease6-get-page`` command:

::

   {
       "command": "lease6-get-page",
       "arguments": {
           "from": "::",
           "limit": 6
       }
   }

The response has the following structure:

::

   {
       "arguments": {
           "leases": [
               {
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:2::1",
                   ...
               },
               {
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:2::9",
                   ...
               },
               {
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:3::1",
                   ...
               },
               {
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:5::3",
                   ...
               }
               {
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:4::1",
                   ...
               },
               {
                   "ip-address": "2001:db8:2::7",
                   ...
               }

           ],
           "count": 6
       },
       "result": 0,
       "text": "6 IPv6 lease(s) found."
   }

Note that the leases' details were excluded from the response above for
brevity.

Generally, the returned list is not sorted in any particular order. Some
lease database backends may sort leases in ascending order of addresses,
but the controlling client must not rely on this behavior. In cases of
highly distributed databases, such as Cassandra, ordering may be
inefficient or even impossible.

The ``count`` parameter contains the number of returned leases on the
page.

To fetch the next page, the client must use the last address of the
current page as an input to the next ``lease4-get-page`` or
``lease6-get-page`` command call. In this example it is:

::

   {
       "command": "lease6-get-page",
       "arguments": {
           "from": "2001:db8:2::7",
           "count": 6
       }
   }

because 2001:db8:2::7 is the last address on the current page.

The client may assume that it has reached the last page when the
``count`` value is lower than that specified in the command; this
includes the case when the ``count`` is equal to 0, meaning that no
leases were found.

.. _command-lease6-get-by-hostname:

The lease4-get-by-\*, lease6-get-by-\* Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``leaseX-get-by-Y`` can be used to query the lease database and
retrieve all existing leases with a specified hardware address (IPv4
only), client id IPv4 only), duid (IPv6 only) identifiers or hostname.

An example ``lease4-get-by-hw-address`` command for getting IPv4 leases
with a given hardware address is:

::

    {
        "command": "lease4-get-by-hw-address",
        "arguments": {
            "hw-address": "08:08:08:08:08:08"
        }
    }

An example of the ``lease6-get-by-hostname`` is:

::

    {
        "command": "lease6-get-by-hostname",
        "arguments": {
            "hostname": "myhost.example.org"
        }
    }

The by key is the only parameter. The returned response contains a detailed
list of leases in the same format than ``leaseX-get-all``. This list can be
empty and usually is never large.

.. _command-lease4-del:

.. _command-lease6-del:

The lease4-del, lease6-del Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``leaseX-del`` can be used to delete a lease from the lease database.
There are two types of parameters this command supports, similar to the
leaseX-get commands: (address) for both v4 and v6, (subnet-id,
identifier-type, identifier) for v4, and (subnet-id, identifier-type,
identifier, type, IAID) for v6. The first type of query is used when the
address (either IPv4 or IPv6) is known, but the details of the lease are
not. One common use case is where an administrator wants a specified
address to no longer be used. The second form of the command uses
identifiers. For maximum flexibility, this interface uses identifiers as
a pair of values: the type and the actual identifier. The currently
supported identifiers are "hw-address" (IPv4 only), "client-id" (IPv4
only), and "duid" (IPv6 only).

An example command for deleting a lease by address is

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-del",
       "arguments": {
           "ip-address": "192.0.2.202"
       }
   }

An example IPv4 lease deletion by "hw-address" is:

::

   {
     "command": "lease4-del",
     "arguments": {
       "identifier": "08:08:08:08:08:08",
       "identifier-type": "hw-address",
       "subnet-id": 44
     }
   }


As of Kea 1.7.10, a new parameter, ``update-ddns``, is supported (IPv4 and IPv6).
When true it instructs the server to queue a request to kea-dhcp-ddns to
remove DNS entries after the lease is successfully deleted if:

- DDNS updating is enabled. (i.e. "dhcp-ddns":{ "enable-updates": true })
- The lease's hostname is not be empty.
- At least one of the lease's DNS direction flags (fdqn_fwd or fdqn_rev) is true.

This parameter defaults to false. An example of its use is shown below:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-del",
       "arguments": {
           "ip-address": "192.0.2.202",
           "update-ddns": true
       }
   }


``leaseX-del`` returns a result that indicates the outcome of the
operation. It has one of the following values: 0 (success), 1 (error),
or 3 (empty). The empty result means that a query has been completed
properly, but the object (a lease in this case) has not been found.

.. _command-lease4-update:

.. _command-lease6-update:

The lease4-update, lease6-update Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``lease4-update`` and ``lease6-update`` commands can be used to
update existing leases. Since all lease database backends are indexed by
IP addresses, it is not possible to update an address, but all other
fields may be altered. If an address needs to be changed, please use
``leaseX-del`` followed by ``leaseX-add``.

The subnet-id parameter is optional. If not specified, or if the
specified value is 0, Kea will try to determine its value by running a
subnet-selection procedure. If specified, however, its value must match
the existing subnet.

The optional boolean parameter "force-create" specifies whether the
lease should be created if it does not exist in the database. It defaults
to false, which indicates that the lease is not created if it does not
exist. In such a case, an error is returned as a result of trying to
update a non-existing lease. If the "force-create" parameter is set to
true and the updated lease does not exist, the new lease is created as a
result of receiving the ``leaseX-update``.

An example of a command to update an IPv4 lease is:

::

   {
     "command": "lease4-update",
     "arguments": {
       "ip-address": "192.0.2.1",
       "hostname": "newhostname.example.org",
       "hw-address": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f",
       "subnet-id": 44,
       "force-create": true
     }
   }

An example of a command to update an IPv6 lease is:

::

   {
     "command": "lease6-update",
     "arguments": {
       "ip-address": "2001:db8::1",
       "duid": "88:88:88:88:88:88:88:88",
       "iaid": 7654321,
       "hostname": "newhostname.example.org",
       "subnet-id": 66,
       "force-create": false
     }
   }

.. _command-lease4-wipe:

.. _command-lease6-wipe:

The lease4-wipe, lease6-wipe Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``lease4-wipe`` and ``lease6-wipe`` are designed to remove all leases
associated with a given subnet. This administrative task is expected to
be used when an existing subnet is being retired. Note that the leases
are not properly expired; no DNS updates are carried out, no log
messages are created, and hooks are not called for the leases being
removed.

An example of ``lease4-wipe`` is:

::

   {
     "command": "lease4-wipe",
     "arguments": {
       "subnet-id": 44
     }
   }

An example of ``lease6-wipe`` is:

::

   {
     "command": "lease6-wipe",
     "arguments": {
       "subnet-id": 66
     }
   }

The commands return a text description of the number of leases removed,
plus the status code 0 (success) if any leases were removed or 3 (empty)
if there were no leases. Status code 1 (error) may be returned if the
parameters are incorrect or some other exception is encountered.

Subnet-id 0 has a special meaning; it tells Kea to delete leases from
all configured subnets. Also, the subnet-id parameter may be omitted. If
not specified, leases from all subnets are wiped.

Note: not all backends support this command.

.. _command-lease4-resend-ddns:

.. _command-lease6-resend-ddns:

The lease4-resend-ddns, lease6-resend-ddns Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``lease4-resend-ddns`` or ``lease6-resend-ddns`` can be used to generate
a request to kea-dhcp-ddns to update the DNS entries for an existing
lease.  The desired lease is selected by a single parameter, "ip-address".
In order for an update request to be generated, DDNS updating must be enabled
and DNS entries must have already been made (or attempted) for the lease.
In other words all of the following must be true:

- DDNS updating must be enabled. (i.e. "dhcp-ddns":{ "enable-updates": true"})
- The lease's hostname must not be empty.
- At least one of the lease's DNS direction flags (fdqn_fwd or fdqn_rev) must be true.

An example ``lease4-resend-ddns`` command for getting a lease using an IPv4
address is:

::

   {
       "command": "lease4-resend-ddns",
       "arguments": {
           "ip-address": "192.0.2.1"
       }
   }

An example of the ``lease6-resend-ddns`` query is:

::

   {
     "command": "lease6-resend-ddns",
     "arguments": {
       "ip-address": "2001:db8:1::1"
     }
   }

``leaseX-resend-ddns`` returns a result that indicates a result of the operation.
It has one of the following values: 0 (success), 1 (error), or 3 (empty). An empty
result means that a query has been completed properly, but the object (a lease in
this case) has not been found.

A successful result does not mean that DNS has been successfully updated. It
indicates that a request to update DNS has been successfully created and
queued for transmission to kea-dhcp-ddns.

An example result returned when the lease was found:

::

   {
     "result": 0,
     "text": "NCR generated for: 2001:db8:1::1, hostname: example.com."
   }
